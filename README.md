Overview of the school district analysis
After doing a school district analysis, it was reported that academic dishonesty was discovered in the math and reading test scores of Thomas High School among all district schools. Specifically, the scores for ninth graders were modified. As a result, the previous analysis must be adjusted by replacing the math and reading scores for the ninth-grade students need to be replaced with "NaN" values and the analysis for the district re-run.

## Results
The school district has 39,170 number of students. Since 9th graders from Thomas High School have been removed for the purpose of evaluation of academic dishonesty. Following are my observations.

There are total of 1635 students in Thomas High School. Where 461 students from 9th grade have been eliminated. which is perhaps a small fraction of total number of students in a district. Anticipation is there would be overall change in decimals. Lets see what several summaries say.

## School District Analysis results
Repeat the school district analysis. Since all the ninth graders from Thomas High School had their scores replaced the particular focus of the analysis re-run was the focus on how this adjustment affected the school district analysis was altered. Primary areas of focus were:

 - Average math and reading scores at Thomas High School 
 - Percentage of students passing according to math scores 
 - Percentage of students passing according to reading scores 
 - Overall percentage of students who passed both math and reading 
 - Percentage passing math, reading, and overall, by budget per student 
 - Percentage passing math, reading, and overall, by school size 
 - Placement of schools overall by score values relative to each other

# School District Summary

Total Students As the data adjustment affected the scores of the ninth graders but did not remove them from the count of the school students, the total number of students in the district should not have been altered.
